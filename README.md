# Functional-programming-in-Python
Function programming in python using higher order function and currying.

Lets Understaned Higher Order Function (HOF)
  
HOF if Function which will accept argument as function and return function as well.

Currying
'''
  We can use higher-order functions to convert a function that takes 
  multiple arguments into a chain of functions that each take a single
  argument. More specifically, given a function f(x, y), we can define
  a function g such that g(x)(y) is equivalent to f(x, y). Here, g is a
  higher-order function that takes in a single argument x and returns 
  another function that takes in a single argument y. This transformation 
  is called currying.
